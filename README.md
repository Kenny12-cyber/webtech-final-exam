LUX FASHION ONLINE SHOPPPING APPLICATION 

 overview
 ............
 A modern, user-friendly online shopping application built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL , designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience with secure authentication, product management, and order processing.
 
üîô Backend Technologies & Architecture
...........................................
This project uses a powerful combination of modern Java-based tools and frameworks to build a secure, efficient, and scalable backend system. Here's a breakdown of the core components:

1.‚úÖ Spring Boot
.........................
Spring Boot is a robust and widely-used Java framework that simplifies the development of backend applications. It allows developers to focus on business logic by handling most configurations automatically.

Supports rapid development and deployment.

Integrates easily with other Spring modules.

üîê Spring Security
....................
Spring Security provides comprehensive security features for Java applications.

Manages authentication (verifying users) and authorization (access control).

Helps protect endpoints and user data from unauthorized access.

Supports session management, password encryption, and role-based access control.

üóÇÔ∏è Spring Data JPA
..........................
Spring Data JPA simplifies interacting with the database using Java objects.

Uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to map Java classes to database tables.

Allows you to perform CRUD operations with minimal boilerplate code.

Works seamlessly with various databases, including PostgreSQL.

üêò PostgreSQL
.....................
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system.

Used to store and manage user, product, and order data.

Ensures data integrity, security, and supports advanced querying.

üß± Architectural Patterns
üß≠ Model-View-Controller (MVC)
The application follows the MVC architecture, which separates concerns in the application:

Model: Represents the data and business logic (e.g., entities like User, Product, Order).

View: Not applicable in pure backend, but if using Thymeleaf or another UI layer, it handles presentation.

Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them using services, and returns responses (often JSON).

MVC improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

üåê RESTful API
.........................
The backend exposes a RESTful API, making it easy for frontend apps or external systems to communicate.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a standard for designing networked applications.

Each API endpoint corresponds to a specific resource or operation, like:

GET /users ‚Äì retrieve users

POST /products ‚Äì add a new product

PUT /orders/{id} ‚Äì update an order

DELETE /users/{id} ‚Äì delete a user

Data is exchanged in JSON format, making it lightweight and easy to use.
