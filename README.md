🔙 Backend Technologies & Architecture

This project uses a powerful combination of modern Java-based tools and frameworks to build a secure, efficient, and scalable backend system. Here's a breakdown of the core components:

✅ Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a robust and widely-used Java framework that simplifies the development of backend applications. It allows developers to focus on business logic by handling most configurations automatically.

Supports rapid development and deployment.

Integrates easily with other Spring modules.

🔐 Spring Security

Spring Security provides comprehensive security features for Java applications.

Manages authentication (verifying users) and authorization (access control).

Helps protect endpoints and user data from unauthorized access.

Supports session management, password encryption, and role-based access control.

🗂️ Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA simplifies interacting with the database using Java objects.

Uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to map Java classes to database tables.

Allows you to perform CRUD operations with minimal boilerplate code.

Works seamlessly with various databases, including PostgreSQL.

🐘 PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system.

Used to store and manage user, product, and order data.

Ensures data integrity, security, and supports advanced querying.

🧱 Architectural Patterns

🧭 Model-View-Controller (MVC)
The application follows the MVC architecture, which separates concerns in the application:

Model: Represents the data and business logic (e.g., entities like User, Product, Order).

View: Not applicable in pure backend, but if using Thymeleaf or another UI layer, it handles presentation.

Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them using services, and returns responses (often JSON).

MVC improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

🌐 RESTful API
The backend exposes a RESTful API, making it easy for frontend apps or external systems to communicate.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a standard for designing networked applications.

Each API endpoint corresponds to a specific resource or operation, like:

GET /users – retrieve users

POST /products – add a new product

PUT /orders/{id} – update an order

DELETE /users/{id} – delete a user

Data is exchanged in JSON format, making it lightweight and easy to use.




🎨 Frontend Overview
The frontend of Lux Fashion Online Shopping Application is built using Thymeleaf, a modern server-side Java template engine integrated with Spring Boot.

Key Features:
Thymeleaf Templates: Dynamically rendered HTML pages using Spring Boot data models.

Responsive UI: Clean and user-friendly interface designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (if used).

Form Handling: Integrated with Spring MVC to process login, registration, product creation, and order forms.

Dynamic Content Rendering: Product listings, shopping cart contents, and user-specific data rendered directly on the server side.

Pages Included:
🏠 Home Page – Displays product listings with categories and search filters.

🔐 Authentication Pages – Login, Register, and Role-based access (Admin/User).

🛍️ Product Pages – View products, product details, and manage inventory (for admins).

🛒 Cart & Orders – Add to cart, view cart, and place orders with confirmation.

⚙️ Dashboard (Admin) – Manage users, products, and view order summaries.




✨ Key Features
🔐 User Authentication

Sign Up: New users can create an account by entering their name, email, and password.

Sign In: Existing users can log in securely using their credentials.

Role-Based Access: Separate access for regular users and administrators.

🛍️ Product Management

Product Listings: Browse all available products with real-time stock status.

Product Details: View comprehensive information including name, price, description, and availability.

Search & Filter: Search products by name or category to quickly find items of interest.

🛒 Shopping Cart & Orders


Add to Cart: Users can add desired products to their personal shopping cart.

Cart Management: Update item quantities or remove products before placing an order.



🛠️ Admin Dashboard

User Management: View, edit, or delete registered users.

Product Management: Add, update, or remove products in the store.

Order Management: Monitor and manage customer orders effectively.

✅ Implemented Scenarios:

Invalid Login: Displays an error message when incorrect credentials are entered.

Form Validation Errors: Notifies users if fields are missing or formatted incorrectly (e.g., invalid email, empty password).

Resource Not Found (404): Custom error page for non-existent routes or product pages.

Access Denied (403): Prevents unauthorized access and redirects users with a meaningful message.

Server Errors (500): Friendly message shown if an internal server error occurs.

Cart/Order Errors: Prevents checkout if cart is empty or stock is unavailable, with real-time feedback.
