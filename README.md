🛠️ Technologies Used
🔙 Backend:
Spring Boot: Java-based framework to handle server-side logic.

Spring MVC: Follows the Model-View-Controller pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

Spring Security: Provides secure user authentication and authorization.

Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database interactions using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

🗃️ Database:
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing users, products, and order data.

🌐 Architecture
🧱 MVC (Model-View-Controller)
The backend follows the MVC architecture:

Model: Represents the application's data and business logic.

View: Not directly applicable in backend, but interfaces with frontend clients.

Controller: Handles HTTP requests and coordinates between Model and View.

🌍 RESTful API
The application exposes a clean and well-structured RESTful API:

Enables communication between the backend and frontend or external systems.

Follows REST principles for resource-based interaction using HTTP methods:

GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
